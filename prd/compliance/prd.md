# Product Requirements Document: Project Compliance with ExpressJS + Prisma Template Specification

## Introduction/Overview

This PRD outlines the requirements for achieving 100% compliance with the ExpressJS + Prisma template specification. The project currently demonstrates 94.4% compliance but requires several structural and architectural adjustments to fully align with the established template standards. The goal is to refactor the codebase incrementally while maintaining all existing functionality and ensuring automated tests continue to pass.

## Goals

1. **Achieve 100% compliance** with the ExpressJS + Prisma template specification
2. **Maintain existing functionality** without breaking changes to the API or user experience
3. **Ensure all automated tests pass** after each refactoring phase
4. **Improve code maintainability** by following established architectural patterns
5. **Update documentation** to reflect the new structure and serve as a reference for future development

## User Stories

### As a Developer
- I want the project structure to match the established template so I can easily understand where to place new code
- I want consistent naming conventions so I can predict file locations and patterns
- I want clear separation of concerns so I can modify one part without affecting others

### As a Code Reviewer
- I want the codebase to follow established patterns so I can quickly identify deviations
- I want comprehensive test coverage so I can verify changes don't break existing functionality

### As a DevOps Engineer
- I want the project to follow the template structure so I can apply consistent deployment patterns
- I want clear configuration management so I can easily deploy to different environments

## Functional Requirements

### Phase 1: File Structure Refactoring
1. **Create `src/app.ts` file** that handles Express app configuration and middleware setup
2. **Refactor `src/server.ts`** to only handle server startup, graceful shutdown, and process management
3. **Move Express app setup logic** from server.ts to app.ts
4. **Ensure proper separation of concerns** between app configuration and server lifecycle

### Phase 2: Component Architecture Standardization
1. **Verify component auto-discovery pattern** is fully implemented and working
2. **Ensure all component files use plural naming convention** (e.g., `users.*.ts`)
3. **Update any singular file references** to match the plural convention
4. **Verify component registry** properly mounts all discovered components

### Phase 3: Database Architecture Simplification
1. **Document dual-database approach** as a migration strategy in README.md
2. **Ensure Prisma is clearly positioned** as the single source of truth for data models
3. **Update configuration validation** to match specification examples
4. **Verify environment variable validation** covers all required configuration

### Phase 4: Testing and Quality Assurance
1. **Ensure comprehensive test coverage** for all components
2. **Verify test utilities match** specification requirements
3. **Run full test suite** after each refactoring phase
4. **Validate component tests** follow established patterns

### Phase 5: Documentation Updates
1. **Update README.md** to reflect new file structure
2. **Ensure architectural principles** are clearly documented
3. **Update any code references** that point to old file locations
4. **Create migration guide** for developers working with the refactored code

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- **Adding new features** beyond what's needed for compliance
- **Changing the API contract** or breaking existing functionality
- **Removing MongoDB support** (will be documented as migration strategy)
- **Performance optimizations** unrelated to compliance
- **UI/UX changes** (this is a backend template compliance project)

## Design Considerations

### File Organization
- Follow the established template structure exactly as specified
- Maintain clear separation between app configuration and server lifecycle
- Ensure consistent naming conventions across all components

### Code Quality
- Maintain existing code quality standards
- Ensure all refactoring follows established patterns
- Preserve existing error handling and logging patterns

## Technical Considerations

### Refactoring Approach
- **Incremental changes**: Break down into small, manageable phases
- **Test-driven**: Ensure tests pass after each phase before proceeding
- **Backward compatibility**: Maintain existing API contracts and functionality
- **Git workflow**: Use feature branches for each phase with proper testing

### Dependencies
- **Prisma**: Must remain as the primary ORM
- **Express.js**: Must maintain current version and configuration
- **Testing framework**: Must preserve existing Jest and Playwright setup
- **Quality tools**: Must maintain ESLint, Prettier, and Husky configuration

### Migration Strategy
- **Dual database support**: Document as intentional migration strategy
- **Feature flags**: Maintain existing USE_PRISMA flag for gradual migration
- **Backward compatibility**: Ensure existing MongoDB code continues to work

## Success Metrics

1. **Compliance Score**: Achieve 100% compliance with the template specification
2. **Test Coverage**: All automated tests must pass after each refactoring phase
3. **Code Quality**: Maintain or improve existing code quality scores
4. **Documentation**: README.md and other docs must accurately reflect the new structure
5. **Developer Experience**: New developers should be able to follow the template patterns without confusion

## Open Questions

1. **Component Registry**: Does the existing component registry fully implement the auto-discovery pattern described in the specification?
2. **File Naming**: Are there any existing files that don't follow the plural naming convention that need to be identified?
3. **Configuration Validation**: Are there any environment variables currently missing from the validation schema?
4. **Testing Patterns**: Do the existing test utilities fully match the specification requirements?

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: File Structure (Week 1)
- Create app.ts and refactor server.ts
- Update imports and references
- Run full test suite

### Phase 2: Component Standardization (Week 2)
- Verify and fix component naming
- Test component auto-discovery
- Update any broken references

### Phase 3: Database Documentation (Week 3)
- Update configuration validation
- Document dual-database approach
- Verify Prisma integration

### Phase 4: Testing Validation (Week 4)
- Ensure comprehensive test coverage
- Verify test utilities compliance
- Run full test suite

### Phase 5: Documentation Updates (Week 5)
- Update README.md and other docs
- Create migration guide
- Final compliance verification

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Breaking Changes**: Each phase will be tested thoroughly before proceeding
2. **Test Failures**: Maintain ability to rollback changes if tests fail
3. **Documentation Drift**: Update documentation immediately after each phase
4. **Developer Confusion**: Provide clear migration guides and examples

## Acceptance Criteria

The project will be considered compliant when:

1. ✅ All automated tests pass
2. ✅ File structure matches the template specification exactly
3. ✅ Component naming follows established conventions
4. ✅ Documentation accurately reflects the new structure
5. ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
6. ✅ 100% compliance score achieved
7. ✅ Component auto-discovery works as specified
8. ✅ Configuration validation matches specification examples
