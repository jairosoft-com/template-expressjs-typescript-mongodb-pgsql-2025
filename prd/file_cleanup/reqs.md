# File Cleanup Requirements

## Overview
This document outlines files that can be safely deleted or cleaned up to improve project maintainability and reduce clutter.

## Files to Delete

### 1. Build Artifacts & Generated Files
- **`dist/`** - Entire directory (contains compiled JavaScript files and source maps)
  - **Reason**: Generated during build process, should not be committed to version control
  - **Note**: Already in .gitignore, but directory exists in workspace
- **`/generated/prisma`** - Prisma generated client files
  - **Reason**: Auto-generated by Prisma CLI, should not be committed
  - **Note**: Already in .gitignore, but may exist in workspace

### 2. Test Results & Reports
- **`test-results/`** - Entire directory
  - **Reason**: Contains temporary test execution results, regenerated on each test run
  - **Note**: Already in .gitignore
- **`playwright-report/`** - Entire directory
  - **Reason**: Contains HTML test reports, regenerated on each e2e test run
  - **Note**: Already in .gitignore
- **`/coverage`** - Test coverage reports
  - **Reason**: Generated by Jest during test runs, should not be committed
  - **Note**: Already in .gitignore, but may exist in workspace

### 3. Outdated Configuration Files
- **`.eslintrc.json`**
  - **Reason**: Project uses modern `eslint.config.mjs` flat config format
  - **Note**: This file is redundant and may cause confusion

### 4. Archive & Temporary Files
- **`archives/TODO-Wed-Aug-6th.md`**
  - **Reason**: Outdated TODO file from August 6th, likely superseded by current TODO.md
- **`.claude/settings.local.json`**
  - **Reason**: Local Claude AI settings, should not be in version control
  - **Note**: Should be added to .gitignore
- **`.DS_Store`** - macOS system files
  - **Reason**: macOS system-generated files, should not be in version control
  - **Note**: Already in .gitignore, but may exist in workspace

### 5. Redundant Test Files
- **`__tests__/`** - Entire directory
  - **Reason**: Contains system validation tests that may be outdated
  - **Note**: Test files should be co-located with components (as per project structure)

### 6. E2E Test Artifacts
- **`e2e/pages/register.page.js`** and **`register.page.js.map`**
  - **Reason**: Compiled JavaScript files, should be generated during test execution
  - **Note**: Source TypeScript files should remain

### 7. Log Files & Environment Files
- **`*.log`** - All log files
  - **Reason**: Generated during application runtime, should not be committed
  - **Note**: Already in .gitignore, but may exist in workspace
- **`npm-debug.log*`** - npm debug logs
  - **Reason**: Generated by npm during package operations, should not be committed
  - **Note**: Already in .gitignore, but may exist in workspace
- **`yarn-debug.log*`** - yarn debug logs
  - **Reason**: Generated by yarn during package operations, should not be committed
  - **Note**: Already in .gitignore, but may exist in workspace
- **`yarn-error.log*`** - yarn error logs
  - **Reason**: Generated by yarn during package operations, should not be committed
  - **Note**: Already in .gitignore, but may exist in workspace

## Files to Review Before Deletion

### 1. Documentation Files
- **`PROJECT_STATUS.md`** - Check if status information is current
- **`TODO.md`** - Verify if todos are still actionable

### 2. Component Test Files
- **`src/components/test-component-*`** directories in dist/
  - **Reason**: Appear to be temporary test components
  - **Note**: Verify these are not needed for current development

## Cleanup Scripts

### Package.json Scripts to Add
```json
"clean:all": "npm run clean && rm -rf archives .claude __tests__ generated coverage",
"clean:config": "rm -f .eslintrc.json",
"clean:docs": "rm -f PROJECT_STATUS.md TODO.md",
"clean:logs": "rm -f *.log npm-debug.log* yarn-debug.log* yarn-error.log*",
"clean:system": "find . -name '.DS_Store' -delete"
```

### Manual Cleanup Commands
```bash
# Remove build artifacts
rm -rf dist/ generated/

# Remove test results
rm -rf test-results/ playwright-report/ coverage/

# Remove outdated config
rm -f .eslintrc.json

# Remove archives
rm -rf archives/

# Remove local AI settings
rm -rf .claude/

# Remove redundant test directory
rm -rf __tests__/

# Remove log files
rm -f *.log npm-debug.log* yarn-debug.log* yarn-error.log*

# Remove macOS system files
find . -name ".DS_Store" -delete
```

## Benefits of Cleanup

1. **Reduced Repository Size**: Remove unnecessary files and build artifacts
2. **Improved Clarity**: Eliminate outdated configuration files
3. **Better Maintainability**: Focus on current, relevant files
4. **Faster Operations**: Reduced file scanning and processing
5. **Cleaner Development Environment**: Less visual clutter in IDE

## Post-Cleanup Actions

1. Update `.gitignore` to include `.claude/` directory
2. Verify all tests still pass after removing test files
3. Ensure build process works correctly without `dist/` directory
4. Update documentation if any removed files were referenced
5. Consider adding cleanup scripts to CI/CD pipeline
6. Ensure Prisma client generation works correctly after removing `/generated/prisma`

## Risk Assessment

- **Low Risk**: Build artifacts, test results, archives, log files, macOS system files
- **Medium Risk**: Configuration files, test files, Prisma generated files
- **High Risk**: None identified

## Important Notes

- **Prisma Generated Files**: These will be regenerated when running `npx prisma generate`
- **Build Artifacts**: These will be regenerated when running `npm run build`
- **Test Results**: These will be regenerated when running tests

## Files to Keep (Not for Deletion)

The following files should **NOT** be deleted as they are important for the project:

1. **`Dockerfile.e2e`** - Required for end-to-end testing in Docker environment
2. **`src/components/structure.spec.ts`** - Important structure validation tests
3. **`.env*` files** - Environment configuration files (already protected by .gitignore)
4. **`CLAUDE.md`** - Important project documentation and guidelines

All identified files for deletion are either generated, outdated, or redundant with current project structure.
