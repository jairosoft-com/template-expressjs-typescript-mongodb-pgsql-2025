# Git Branch Cleanup Requirements

## Objective
Clean up local git branches to reduce repository clutter and improve maintainability by removing completed and merged phase branches.

## Current State
- **Active Branch**: `main` (current)
- **Total Local Branches**: 8
- **Branches to Remove**: 7
- **Branches to Keep**: 1 (`main`)

## Requirements

### 1. Safe Branch Removal
**Priority**: High
**Description**: Remove all local phase branches that have been fully merged into main
**Rationale**: All phase branches show complete integration with main branch
**Risk**: None - all work is safely preserved in main and remote repositories

### 2. Target Branches for Deletion
**Priority**: High
**Description**: Remove the following local branches:
- `chore/post-phase5-cleanup`
- `feature/phase3-database-simplification`
- `phase-1-critical-structure-config-fixes`
- `phase-2-logging-error-handling`
- `phase-3-component-architecture`
- `phase-4-prisma-integration`
- `phase-5-final-polish`

### 3. Verification Requirements
**Priority**: Medium
**Description**: Ensure all branches are safely removed by:
- Confirming no unmerged commits exist
- Verifying all work is preserved in main branch
- Checking remote branches remain intact

### 4. Cleanup Method
**Priority**: Medium
**Description**: Use git branch deletion commands:
```bash
# Individual branch removal
git branch -d <branch-name>

# Or bulk removal
git branch | grep -v "main" | xargs git branch -d
```

### 5. Post-Cleanup Validation
**Priority**: Low
**Description**: Verify cleanup success by:
- Running `git branch` to confirm only main remains locally
- Checking `git branch -a` shows remote branches are preserved
- Confirming no git errors or warnings

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All 7 phase branches are removed locally
- [ ] Only `main` branch remains locally
- [ ] Remote branches are preserved
- [ ] No git errors or warnings
- [ ] Repository is cleaner and more maintainable

## Notes
- All branches are confirmed merged into main
- No unmerged work exists
- Remote repositories contain all historical data
- This is a safe cleanup operation with zero risk of data loss
